# jiraCloneSpringBoot

A little project I did for work as part of a "refinement process".

In order to run you have to set up a postgreSQL database and add it to the ``application.properties`` file.

API path for testing with Postman is ``api/issue`` and the whole things runs locally on ``localhost:8080``
